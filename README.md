# fMRI
Repository for the 3T fMRI versions of the auditory and visual motor imagery tasks used in my thesis (Chapter 3). Data is not currently available due to GDPR.

## 3T Versions
3T Versions contains each task (auditory imagery, visual imagery, auditory reaction time and visual reaction time) separately as this made things easiest at the Birkbeck-UCL Centre for NeuroImaging. Note that the Cogent toolbox is required for the experiment to run correctly, and the experiments are set up to run on two/three screens allowing for monitoring of responses as well as viewing the participant's screen. Your mileage may vary if using the code straight out.

## stimlists
The stimlists folder contains a number of example stimulus lists, which have to be pre-randomised. Stimulus list 1 provides the basis for all randomised lists

## stimuli
The stimuli folder contains all stimuli used, as well as some older version which are not used in this experiment.
